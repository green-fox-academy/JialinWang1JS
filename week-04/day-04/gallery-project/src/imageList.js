		description: `In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.`

		header: 'Nice rainbow trout caugth',
		description: `When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.`

By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.`

		description: `Łukasz is a Warsaw-based designer. During Poland's first free elections in 1989, he joined Gazeta Wyborcza, the first independent daily newspaper, and soon found a home in the design department co-creating page layouts and his first typeface. In 2007, he created a three-style Latin and Cyrillic corporate family for empik, one of Poland’s largest retail networks. In 2010, he started the Lato project, to develop a high-quality open-source font family.`
