    <!-- You can work in the html or in a separate js file. Like:
      Here is an image inspector, but the buttons are not implemented yet, that will
      be your task!
       - the nav buttons (up, down, left, right) move the background by 10px
       - the zoom buttons increase/decrease the image by 20%
       - attach only two event listeners to the nav element
         - one for navigation
         - one for zooming
    OR
    <script src="bubbling.js"></script> -->
